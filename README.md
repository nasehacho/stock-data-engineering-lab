## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to practice the methodologies apparent in object oriented programming. Particularly the method of polymorphism with building various functions, methods, and lists under a class to perform stock data statistical analysis. Object oriented programming proves it's advantage by associating data and behavior together in an object for viewers to understand how a line of code runs.  

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Object Oriented Programming

### Technologies
* Python


## Project Description
* Utilizing statistics package to compute the mean, median, and standard deviation of stock data
* Before computing statistical data, the stock data file must be cleaned to ensure that there are no strings when computing
* Used try-except code block with .strip() function and float() function to remove any whitespaces as well as convert all string values into numerical values for computing 
* Challenges: Understanding how to build a class without given documentation
